# Expo CLI: Module not found error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Expo CLI projects where the module is not found during the import process. The error typically arises from issues with import paths, file structures, or missing packages.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains an example of incorrect module import, which leads to the Module not found error.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the code with the proper import paths and necessary modifications.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the project's dependencies.
3. Attempt to run the `bug.js` file. This will result in the Module not found error.
4. Modify the import statements in `bug.js` to match the structure of `bugSolution.js`.
5. Re-run to see that the error is now resolved.
